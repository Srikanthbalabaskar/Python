    "The pandas package is the most important tool at the disposal of Data Scientists and Analysts working in Python today. The powerful machine learning and glamorous visualization tools may get all the attention, but pandas is the backbone of most data projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Pandas\" is derived from the term \"panel data\", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals. — Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're thinking about data science as a career, then it is imperative that one of the first things you do is learn pandas. In this post, we will go over the essential bits of information about pandas, including how to install it, its uses, and how it works with other common Python data analysis packages such as matplotlib and sci-kit learn. Also note that Pandas is built over Numpy Package. "

    "Pandas has so many uses that it might make sense to list the things it can't do instead of what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is essentially your data’s home. Through pandas, you get acquainted with your data by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you want to explore a dataset stored in a CSV on your computer. Pandas will extract the data from that CSV into a DataFrame — a table, basically — then let you do things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate statistics and answer questions about the data, like\n",
    "- What's the average, median, max, or min of each column? \n",
    "- Does column A correlate with column B?\n",
    "- What does the distribution of data in column C look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean the data by doing things like removing missing values and filtering rows or columns by some criteria\n",
    "Visualize the data with help from Matplotlib. Plot bars, lines, histograms, bubbles, and more.\n",
    "Store the cleaned, transformed data back into a CSV, other file or database\n",
    "Before you jump into the modeling or the complex visualizations you need to have a good understanding of the nature of your dataset and pandas is the best avenue through which to do that."
